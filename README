INTRO

Welcome! This package adds Template Toolkit 2 support to
an existing PerlPoint installation. As a result one can
use templates written in TT2 syntax.


INSTALLATION

Install this module as usual with cpanp or cpan, or use
the manual sequence of unpacking and

  perl Makefile.PL
  make test install distclean


DOCUMENTATION

Documentation is in a really pure state now, sorry. That's why
this release is declared a beta.

The best intro to TT2 styles at the moment is the S5 demo style
in the PerlPoint-styles package on CPAN or the SourceForge
project page.

To get an impression of the data structure passed to templates
please use the TT2 dump features. I hope to document this
structure soon.


SUPPPORT

A PerlPoint mailing list is set up to discuss usage, ideas,
bugs, suggestions and translator development. To subscribe,
please send an empty message to perlpoint-subscribe@perl.org.

If you prefer, you can contact me via perl@jochen-stenzel.de
as well.
